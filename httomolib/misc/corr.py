    """
    Inpainting filter for 3D data, taken from the Larix toolbox
    (C - implementation).

    A morphological inpainting scheme which progresses from the
    edge of the mask inwards. It acts like a diffusion-type process
    but significantly faster in convergence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Input array.
    mask : ndarray
        Input binary mask (uint8) the same size as data,
        integer 1 will define the inpainting area.
    iter : int, optional
        An additional number of iterations to run after the region
        has been inpainted (smoothing effect).
    windowsize_half : int, optional
        Half-window size of the searching window (neighbourhood window).
    method_type : str, optional
        Method type to select for a value in the neighbourhood: mean, median,
        or random. Defaults to "random".
    ncore : int, optional
        The number of CPU cores to use.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Inpainted array.
